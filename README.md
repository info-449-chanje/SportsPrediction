# SportsPrediction
An ios app that allows for predicting the outcomes of sporting events and competing against other players to see who is the best predictor

## User Goals:
 * Prediction/Gambling screen
 * History page to view past outcomes of games played
 * Leaderboard to show highscores aongst different users
 * Results page to view results of past predictions
 * User page to display user info if desired
 * Graph of data to show the user something based on that data (TBD later)
 
## Guest Goals: 
 * Be able to view leaderboards and see what players have the highest scores
 * View the games that are open to predictions but not make any predictions
 
## Optional Goals:
 * Create a way to track admin accounts and allow them to manage the leaderboard to maintain site integrity
 * Create a way for users to make groups with other users to compete within


### Current API:
 * Looking into a couple of API options. There doesn't seem to be any that are free without inputting a cc number on Rapid API
 * TheRundown is 100 calls a day before charge - lots of extra information but SHOULD have live scores
 * Gold Standard is 100 calls a month before charge - pretty simplified information but less calls a month
